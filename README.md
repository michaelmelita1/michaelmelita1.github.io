#### Rebuilding the `Packages` file

With your updated `control` file, build your tweak.
Store the resulting `.deb.` file into the `/debs/` folder of your repo.
Build your `Packages` file and compress with `bzip2`.

```sh
user:~/ $ cd repo
user:~/repo $ dpkg-scanpackages -m ./debs > Packages
user:~/repo $ bzip2 Packages
```
